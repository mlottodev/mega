Chief Anthony Eromosele Enahoro leaving the High Court in Lagos after being sentenced to 15 year's imprisonment for plotting to overthrow the Nigerian Government.

During the 1962 crisis in the old Western region, he was detained along with other Action Group members. Accused of treason during the Awolowo alleged coup trial, Enahoro escaped via Ghana to the United Kingdom in 1963, Nigeria requested Enahoro's extradition under the 1881 Fugitive Offenders Act, preventing his application for political asylum.

Early in 1963, the new leader of the Labour party, Harold Wilson, detected the embarrassment caused by Enahoro's arrest and imprisonment. Labour went on the attack in the House of Commons, with support from some Tories, backed by a media furore. He was once one of the best-known Nigerians in Britain.

He was the "fugitive offender" who triggered days of debate in the House of Commons in 1963 as he battled against extradition.

"The Enahoro affair" became an issue of human rights versus the government's pusillanimous wish not to offend Nigeria, and put the Tory prime minister, Harold Macmillan, and his home secretary, Henry Brooke, in a difficult position.

He was extradited from the UK and imprisoned for treason in 1963. In 1966, he was released by the Military Government.

Image Date: 9th September, 1963.
